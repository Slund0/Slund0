- 👋 Hi, I’m @Slund0
- 👀 I’m interested in WebDev and creating apps that can be used to help users make better decisions by showing them a fuller picture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, HTML, CSS, and Selenium.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enabling future Web3 DAO functionality on my apps to enable users to have a decision on the content they want to see.
